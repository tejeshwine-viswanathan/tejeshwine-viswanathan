### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/blob/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Tejeshwine Viswanathan!

#### -> üìñ I  just graduated from **Rice University** with a Masters' in Electrical and Computer Engineering (specialization in Data Science).  
#### -> üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I am a data scientist at Urbix, Inc.
#### -> üêÄ Have collaborated in the past with UTHealth, Baylor College of Medicine and D2K Lab@Rice University on interesting real-world machine learning projects.

**SKILLS AND ABILITIES**
<br/>
ü§ñ **_Programming Languages_**: Python, R, C/C++, SQL <br/>
üåé **_Languages Known_**: English, French, Tamil, Hindi <br/>
üìÉ **_Certifications_**: Foundation Certificate in Data Science and Programming from *Indian Institute of Technology, Madras*, Mathematics and Bayesian Statistics for ML, Game Theory, Artificial Intelligence <br/>

**PROJECTS**
<br/>
#### 1. Baylor College of Medicine: Data Pipelining for Diagnosing SIDS
    -Performed exploratory data analysis (involving wrangling through signal processing techniques, exploration, supervised and 
    unsupervised machine learning algorithmic modeling, visualization, and statistical inferences) of ECG and breathing waveform 
    data in genetically engineered mice models of ‚ÄòSudden Infant Death Syndrome‚Äô.
    -Feature engineering of specific features in ECG and breathing waveforms in Python to extract potential signatures of SIDS
    that can be used as a prognostic tool in prevention or early detection of succumbing to SIDS.

#### 2. Video Captioning using Deep Learning
    -Captioning videos after feature extraction using a pretrained deep learning model and using sequence-to-sequence deep learning
    architectures such as LSTMs for a frame-by-frame text generation of MSVD video database using Keras and OpenCV.
    
#### 3. Hope Simpson Covid19 Data Analysis and Data Visualization
    -Examined Hope Simpson‚Äôs seasonally mediated virus spread hypothesis for SARS Cov-2 virus by analyzing the spread data from Johns
    Hopkins University‚Äôs database and visualized a region-wise split using Tableau.
    
#### 4. Building a Deep Learning classifier for handwritten data
    -Developed a deep learning convolutional neural network-based classification model using Tensorflow and Keras to achieve a 97.03%
    accuracy for a Kannada based handwritten dataset, an extension to the MNIST dataset.
    
#### 5. Utilizing reconfigurable nature of FPGAs for Deep Learning Algorithmic Implementation
    -Coded simple vector applications and subsequent depth-wise convolutional algorithms in C++ and imported to Vivado HLS and PYNQ 
    framework for hardware deployment on FPGAs. Used pragma directives like unrolling, pipelining, buffers, and kernel optimization
    to reduce the latency of the algorithm in comparison to non-embedded deep learning techniques.
    
#### 6. Developing a preliminary screening technology for detection of paranasal sinusitis
    -Used thermographic analysis of control and test subjects to detect presence of paranasal sinusitis using segmentation in MATLAB. 
    Used a pretrained deep learning model (VGG16) to classify segmented images with 96% accuracy.

**EXPERIENCE**
 
#### 1. TVS Sundaram Fasteners (Autolec) Industrial Internship
    -Proposed a blueprint for an optimal automation-based system to decrease human touchpoints and increase production efficiency in
    a manufacturing plant (Autolec), based on evaluation of key factors such as operation run-time, cost, serviceability, and 
    suitability to the shop floor.
    -Constructed a 2D model using Autodesk‚Äôs AUTOCAD platform and extrapolated to a functioning 3D model using Fusion360.
    -Devised a QR code scanning mechanism using OpenCV for ensuring part traceability.
    -Built a SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) using Arduino as a working model prototype for intermediate part transfer
    and built an app to control it using Android Studio in C++.
    
#### 2. Kempegowda International Airport Limited Research Internship
    -Shadowed a senior automation engineer to understand the practical applications of SCADA and PLC based automation systems in an
    industrial airport setup (Fire Alarm System, Baggage Handling System, Visual Guidance Docking System etc.)

#### 3. FLSmidth & Co Project Internship
    -Built a SCADA mimic and developed a PLC ladder logic in Simatic Step7 platform for a crusher in a cement manufacturing industry
    using a combination of alarms, temperature sensors, level detectors and vibration detectors.
